Priority Queue is a queue in which elements are saved with priority.The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering. A priority queue by default orders a element according to its natural ordering. So if you are saving nos it will be in ascending order.

 ```PriorityQueue<Integer> p = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();```
