## Sliding Window

If problem involves finding a contiguous solution, use sliding window.
The problem involves a data structure that is ordered and iterable like arrays, strings, etc.
The problem is asking to find a subrange in an array/string, contiguous longest, shortest, average or target value.
There is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in O(N2), O(2N) or some other large time complexity.
